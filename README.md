# Matic Cocos Starter Kit

Welcome to the world of blockchain games!

This project is a Game Tutorial built with Matic and Cocos, to democratize the development of modern blockchain games.

1. [Matic](https://matic.network/): Matic Network is a sidechain based scaling solution for public blockchains. It is based on an adapted implementation of Plasma framework. Matic provides scalability while ensuring a superior user experience in a secured and decentralized manner.
2. [Cocos Creator](https://cocos2d-x.org/creator): A set of integrated tools for game development with the core of content creation.

## What can you learn from this tutorial?

You'll learn step by step about how to build modern blockchain games with Matic and Cocos Creator.


## Start the journey of blockchain games

### Set Up Environment

Here we mainly demonstrate Matic's capability to build games efficiently with Cocos Creator. But it's also possible to build game with Cocos2D-X and Matic,

Follow the below steps to set up environment of Matic + Cocos Creator.

1. Install Cocos Creator from https://www.cocos.com/creator (2.0+ preferred) if you haven't done yet
1. Download this tutorial project into your local workspace.
1. For a sample project, install [Matic Plugin for Cocos Creator](https://github.com/think-in-universe/matic-cocos-creator), by following the instructions in the Matic plugin project's documentation.
1. Open the tutorial projects in Cocos Creator, and run the projects with Browser mode to launch the games.

### Level 1: A Basic Matic Demo with Matic and Cocos2D

A Cocos2D demo built with Cocos Creator that demostrates how to get balance, deposit to child chain, transfer in Matic child chain, withdraw to parent chain, etc.

## Advanced Topics

### Use Matic in Cocos2D-X projects

Besides Cocos Creator, it's common to use cocos2d-x directly to build games.
Learn from [this project](./matic-cocos2d-x) for details of developing with Cocos2D-X and Matic.
